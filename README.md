# Data Fest Hackathon - Improving Educational Outcomes in Africa

# Problem Statement
Across many African countries, there has been a long-standing concern about the declining quality of elementary and secondary education. Recent statistics from JAMB, a Nigerian pre-tertiary examination body, reveal that 76% of students who sat for the 2024 UTME (Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination) scored less than 200 out of 400 (50%). This significant underperformance highlights a critical issue that needs urgent attention: students are not adequately prepared for these crucial external exams, particularly starting from their Senior Secondary School (SSS) years.

# Key Concerns:
•	Poor Preparation: It has been observed that inadequate preparation from SS1 (Senior Secondary 1) onwards is a major contributor to students failing external exams such as the UTME. This indicates that there’s a need to monitor and support students right from the onset of their senior secondary education to improve their readiness for these critical assessments.
•	Declining Interest in School: Alongside poor academic performance, there has been a growing trend among students to devalue education, popularized by the slogan "School na scam", which reflects a sense of disenchantment with the traditional educational system. Many students have lost interest in school, affecting their motivation and performance.

# Objective:
The goal is to create a monitoring and support system for students starting from SS1 to help track their performance, identify those who need extra support, and provide timely interventions to improve their readiness for external exams. In addition, there is a need to motivate and inspire students by bringing in successful professionals to demonstrate the value of education and provide encouragement. This will help rekindle interest in learning and change the negative mindset that education is unimportant.

# Solution:
The solution will involve:
1.	Performance Tracking: Implementing a system to continuously track students’ academic performance from SS1 onwards across different subjects to identify early signs of struggles and provide necessary interventions.
2.	Targeted Support: Based on performance data, offering tailored support for students (e.g., additional tutoring, counseling) to help them improve in their weak areas.
3.	Motivation and Inspiration: Organizing motivational talks where successful professionals in different fields address students, emphasizing the importance of education as a foundation for their future careers.
By implementing this solution, we can better prepare students for external exams, restore their faith in the educational system, and ultimately improve the overall quality of education in schools.

# Data Sources
The data was sourced from three different schools, and each school provided data related to:
•	Subject Scores: Exam results for students across different subjects.
•	Students: Demographic information, career aspirations, etc.
•	Attendance: Records of student attendance.
•	Financial Data: Details on school financial transactions, categorized by expenses and revenues.
•	Staff: Information about staff members, including personal details, roles, and qualifications (created by the team).
